# Documentation

### ReactiveStackClient
This is the main class.

It processes client subscription requests, creates appropriate stores and subscribes to them to observe changes.

It extends RxJS:Subject, so that any websocket instance can subscribe to it, in order to forward updates back to the client.

### IConnectionManager
Defines a ConnectionManager interface to be implemented by the application using this library.

This implementation is required for the above ReactiveStackClient. An instance of ReactiveStackClient is calling IConnectionManager methods accordingly.

### DataMiddlewareMap
This is a map of all defined Data Middleware methods.

A Data Middleware is tied to a store scope ```'count' | 'one' | 'many'``` and collection name and is used to modify an observed payload if necessary.
For example, if based on users access permissions a portion of the payload needs to be removed or replaced, etc.

### initiateWorkers
Method that initiates all workers. Takes folder path as attribute.

### initiateCronjobs
Method that initiates all cronjobs. Takes folder path as attribute.

## MongoDB
### MongoDBConnector
A MongoDB database connector class, used to initialize the database collection which Mongoose will then use.

### processModels
This method parses all models and adds them to the ```CollectionsModelsMap``` if they pass validation. The method takes the folder path for the models and an optional folder name(s) to exclude, for example ```mixins``` and similar.

### CollectionsModelsMap
This is a map of all Mongoose models and related MongoDB collections. It is populated automatically during the execution of ```processModels```.

### observableModel
Requires MongoDB 3.6+: This method returns an RxJS Subject that can be subscribed to and thus observe a particular MongoDB collection. This method takes a Mongoose model instance.

### observableDatabase
Requires MongoDB 4.0+: This method returns an RxJS Subject that can be subscribed to and thus observe the entire MongoDB database.

## Routes
### processFastifyBlipp
This method stores all fastify routes into the ```RoutesMap``` in order to display them on request as a form of quick routes documentation.

This method is set as ```blippLog``` options attribute during fastify registration of the ```fastify-blipp``` plugin. Eg. ```server.register(fastifyBlipp, {blippLog: processFastifyBlipp});```.

### RoutesMap
This is a map of all available routes. It is populated automatically during the execution of ```processFastifyBlipp```.

### addFastifyRoutes
This method adds all routes to fastify automatically. It requires as parameters a fastify instance and routes folder path.

### cleanRelativePath
Helper metohd used in ```addFastifyRoutes``` to generate the route path from filename and file location relative to routes root folder.

## Store
### AStore
Abstract class for ```CountStore```, ```DocumentStore``` and ```CollectionStore``` implementations.

### EStoreType
Enum for existing store types: ```COUNT | DOCUMENT | COLLECTION```.

### CountStore
Count store, observes a particular query and returns only an integer representing the count of response rows.

### DocumentStore
Document store, observes a particular query and returns all response rows.

### CollectionStore
Collection store, observes a particular query and returns all response rows.

### storeFactory
Store factory method, creates an appropriate AStore instance based on passed subscription parameters.

## Types
These types are self explanatory.
- CronJobType
- WorkerType
- StoreScopeType
- StoreSubscriptionConfigType
- StoreSubscriptionUpdateType
- ConnectionManagerRefreshType
